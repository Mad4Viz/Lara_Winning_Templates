I used AI to create [desired result] for [clients/end-user].

(In under [timeframe])

Here's how to beat [challenge/block]:

Every time I [action] for [clients/end-users], I:
- Open the [AI tool].
- Select "[mode/setting]."
- Pull out [inspiration source/account].
- Start prompting with my all-time favorite prompt:

Prompt:

{Add your prompt}

It will give you [number] near-perfect options.
Select the one you like the most.

Then use the second prompt in my {Add as attachment/image}.

The result? A near-[expert/professional] level {outcome}.

[Popular tool] is all the hype, but people slept on this tool.

It uses [key feature/advantage] + [additional feature].

Save time by using [method/strategy].
Save money by not [outsourcing/task].
Save effort by cutting down [process time].

Use this prompt, format properly, and win [platform/niche].

It has never been easier to enter the top [percentage/group].
