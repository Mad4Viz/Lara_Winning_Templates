{time period} years ago, I made the decision that changed my life.

"[your positive self-affirmation]"

I said to myself {in a situation}.

Tears on my face, tired and fed up.

I turned my pain into power.

All the {your hardships}â€¦
- {action you took overcome it}
- {action you took overcome it}
- {action you took overcome it}
- {action you took overcome it}
- {action you took overcome it}

Destroyed my old 'self' to become my new one.

Stopped waiting for the right {situation}.

I {what final action you took} made my first online dollar.

I haven't stopped since.

Be better or stay bitter.
