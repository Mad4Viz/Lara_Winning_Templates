99% of my followers don't know this about me...

[What thing you failed at but you never mentioned online]

But it wasn't because I couldn't do it:

- {reason you failed}
- {reason you failed}
- {reason you failed}

So I failed and/or quit them all.

Then I found {thing you succeeded at} and stuck to it for {time period}.

I liked it, I committed to it and eventually found success

For months, nothing was happening. But I persisted.

Then {thing that happened}. It changed my life.

Stop quitting so soon.
