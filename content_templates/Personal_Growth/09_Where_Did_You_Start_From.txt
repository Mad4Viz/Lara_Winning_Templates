[Add an image]

This is my [old place/start point] where it all began.

[What did you had at that time], [challenge/hardships], late nights, and obsessing over [focus area].

I was [context/situation] at the time.

That same year, I made my first [milestone].

One year of [action you took] can put you decades ahead.

You just have to make the choice to go all in on [your goal].
