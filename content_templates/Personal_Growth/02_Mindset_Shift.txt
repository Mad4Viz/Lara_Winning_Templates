This 1 mindset shift changed everything.

When I started {thing} I focused on:
{things you did wrong}
{things you did wrong}
{things you did wrong}

I burned out, but not because I was working hard..

It was because my goals didn't align with my purpose.

I was chasing {wrong goals}, not {right goals}.
I was chasing {wrong goals}, not {right goals}.
I was chasing {wrong goals}, not {right goals}.

The reason? My {external factor} made me think that was the goal.

"Woah, everyone has that, so I should too"

A slippery slope.
And an endless chase for {unreal result}.
Because no matter how many success stories we read.

There are 10x failure ones underneath.
Remember that next time you want to quit.
Or feel burned out. Rest and reassess.

Flip the narrative â†’ focus on growing you.
(until the focus is you)
