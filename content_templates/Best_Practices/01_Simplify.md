```
People overcomplicate {thing}

Listen, if you're a {experience level}:

Avoid:
- {thing they should avoid}
- {thing they should avoid}
- {thing they should avoid}
- {thing they should avoid}

Instead:

- {thing they should do}
- {thing they should do}
- {thing they should do}

Focus on this for the first {time frame}.
Build from there.
