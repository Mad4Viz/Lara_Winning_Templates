title: Get the Basics Right

Harsh truth:

- You can take all the online courses
- You can use all the {thing} 'hacks'
- You can read all the [your niche] books
- You can set up a business and put 'CEO' in your headline

But if you aren't:
- Showing up consistently
- [Basics of your niche]
- [Basics of your niche]
- and repeatingâ€¦

You won't get the {success in your niche}.

We get so caught up in learning the HOW, that we forget that we actually need to DO.

You can outperform yourself in 6 months without {conventional thing to do} or finding the next new hack.

Nail down the basics and repeat every day.

That's how you do the how.
