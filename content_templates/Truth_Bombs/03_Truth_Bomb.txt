Too many people overcomplicate {your niche}.

- {common mistakes}
- {common mistakes}
- {common mistakes}

Truth is they only need:
- {best practices}
- {best practices}
- {best practices}

Your audience doesn't care about your {common mistake #1}, they care about {best practice}.

Don't let your overcomplication turn into procrastination
