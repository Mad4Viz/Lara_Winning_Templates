The number 1 reason {thing} fail:

They focus on {not useful outcome}, not {useful outcome}.

- ⁠ ⁠{usual wanna-be tasks}
- ⁠ ⁠{usual wanna-be tasks}
- ⁠ ⁠{usual wanna-be tasks}
- ⁠ ⁠{usual wanna-be tasks}

The result? Lack of {outcome}.

Here's what I did instead:

1.⁠ ⁠{action-items that work}
2.⁠ ⁠{action-items that work}
3.⁠ ⁠{action-items that work}
4.⁠ ⁠{action-items that work}
5.⁠ ⁠{action-items that work}

Stop trying to {not useful outcome} before you {useful outcome}.
Start {not useful outcome} while you're {useful outcome}.

Repetitive {something that works} is/are how you get ahead of 99% of people.
