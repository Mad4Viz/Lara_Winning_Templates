There's too many "I made {success}"

But not enough "I struggled doing xyz"
This year I've:
- {fail}
- {fail}
- {fail}

That's the reality of being {who you are}…
{Describe the failure}
{Describe the failure}
{Describe the failure}

It's not all black and white…
Remind people that not everything's perfect.
