```
I wrote{/made} my first [deliverable] [time period] months ago.

I started from scratch just to [your initial motivation to start].

I would never have thought that today I'd have:

- [Your Current Metrics]
- [Your Current Metrics]
- [Your Current Metrics]

It's crazy how much of a difference [time period] of dedication to a {platform} can make.

Imagine if you started today...

Think of where you would be in [time period] months.
