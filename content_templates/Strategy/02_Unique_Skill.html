Everyone on/in {thing} should be telling stories.

If you want to grow your {venture} fast, use this:

I call it the '{Your Unique Term} {skill}' framework.

- {Your Step-1}
- {Your Step-2}
- {Your Step-3}
- {Your Step-4}

To top it all up, each {deliverable} then has:

- A {unique element} → {its outcome}
- A {unique element} → {its outcome}
- A {unique element} → {its outcome}

This is exactly how my {deliverable} is {ideal outcome}.

Be specific enough to show authority, but generic enough to reach more people.
