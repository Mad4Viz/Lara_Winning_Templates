How to stop overcomplicating your {desired outcome}:

(and create the {ideal process})

Turn your {negative perspective} into {something positive}.

Here's how I did it:

- {Tip #1}
- {Tip #2}
- {Tip #3}
- {Tip #4}

Swap from "Why them?" to "How can I."

Real growth happens when you stop {not useful thing}

And start {useful thing}.

It's always you vs you -- not someone else.
