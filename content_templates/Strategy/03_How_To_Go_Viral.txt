How I go viral every week (you can too)

Stop {what everybody does} → start testing.

- Choose a topic for your post
↳ [your niche] → [topic that works]

- Use a proven viral hook format
↳ {Add a hook related to that topic}

- Use a proven writing framework
↳ {simple framework using an abbreviation}

Test it and see how it performs.

And if the post doesn't perform:

→ Test a different {your unique tip/lever that brings change}
→ Test a different {your unique tip/lever that brings change}
→ Test a different {your unique tip/lever that brings change}

It's not WHAT you say. It's HOW you say it.
