If I had to start from 0 on/for {thing} here's what I'd do:

(how to actually {desired outcome})

â†’ {unfair advantage in that domain}

[add an example of unfair advantages]
[add an example of unfair advantages]
[add an example of unfair advantages]

You'll stick to it longer.
- {tip #1}
- {tip #2}
- {tip #1}

This is exactly how I {what you achieved}.
And how I got {what you achieved #2}.

Pick a problem, solve it and sell the implementation.

This could be via:
{examples}
