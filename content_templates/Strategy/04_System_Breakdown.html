My {year} {your expertise} strategy:

- {frequency} to do X
- {frequency} to do Y

Too simple? Let's break it down:

Weekly, I'm…

- [your output]
- [your output]
- [your output]
- [your output]

In addition:

- I'm spending {time} making each post
- I spend [another task]
- I'm [another task]
- I [metric] {task}

If I was to add {rest of what you do excluding the things you mentioned above} , in all honesty - I'd have a mental breakdown :)

Repurposing is easy but growth and community isn't.

I rather have 2 {what success looks like} than 5 poor {what success looks like}.

Yeah, maybe I'm missing out on omni-{medium} growth…

But it's how I've been able to 'win' on here.

A sustainable and nurtured strategy.

It's chess, not checkers.
